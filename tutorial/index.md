# Welcome to the NNOTT

This documentation site is powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Getting Started

1. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
   ```
2. Serve locally:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```
3. Build static site:
   ```bash
   mkdocs build
   ```

## Next Steps

- Port content from `old_tutorial/` into the new MkDocs structure.
- Update `mkdocs.yml` navigation as pages are added.
- Host the site via GitHub Pages or any static host.
