# About This Tutorial


This project is a guided sandbox for my students to learn deep learning from the ground up. Instead of jumping straight into a large framework, you build every concept gradually:

- **Scalar implementations** show each neuron, gradient, and update explicitly.
- **Vectorized code** demonstrates how the same math translates into efficient NumPy/CuPy operations.
- **Convolutional architectures** introduce modern CNN design patterns without hiding the underlying modules.

## Learning Philosophy

1. **Start simple:** work through the scalar notebooks/scripts to understand backpropagation step by step.
2. **Scale up carefully:** move to vectorized and convolutional modules once the math is clear.
3. **Experiment relentlessly:** use the quick-start scripts, optimization lab, and augmentation playground to test hypotheses.
4. **Document everything:** fill out the [Experiment Log Template](experiment-log-template.md) after each run to build scientific rigor.

## How to Use This Page

- Share this page with new students as an overview of why the repository exists.
- Reference it when explaining course structure or when introducing new sections (Optimizers, Architecture Gallery, etc.).
- Pair it with the [Debug Playbook](debug-playbook.md) so learners know where to go when they get stuck.
