This section collects short references for the utility libraries used throughout the project. Jump directly to the page you need:

- [NumPy](numpy.md) — array operations, broadcasting, and tips for writing vectorized code.
- [matplotlib](matplotlib.md) — plotting utilities for visualizing samples and curves.
- [tqdm](tqdm.md) — progress bars for long-running training loops.
- [CuPy](cupy.md) — GPU-backed NumPy equivalent used by the convolutional trainer.

Use this hub when a notebook or script calls out one of the tools and you need a refresher.
